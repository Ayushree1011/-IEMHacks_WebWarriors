PROBLEM STATEMENT:
In today's fast-paced and stressful world, many individuals face challenges and emotions that they may find difficult to share openly. Which leads to high depression rates among youth as well as increasing suicide rates and wastage of human resources.



PROPOSED SOLUTION:
To address this issue, we aim to create a safe and anonymous venting chat room, where people can express themselves, share their thoughts and feelings, and find support from like-minded individuals without the fear of judgment. This chat room will also incorporate moderation to ensure a respectful and empathetic environment.



TERMINOLOGIES:
Backend: The server-side of a web application that handles data storage, processing, and communication with the client-side.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server. It's commonly used for building server-side applications.
Express.js: A popular web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of APIs and handling of routes.
API (Application Programming Interface): A set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): The protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. It's the foundation of data communication on the web.
WebSocket: A protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, allowing for real-time two-way communication between the client and the server.
Socket.io: A JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers using WebSockets, with built-in support for fallback mechanisms.
Routing: The process of determining how an application responds to a particular request URL. In Express.js, routing involves defining route paths and specifying the corresponding handler functions.
Middleware: Functions that have access to the request and response objects and can perform tasks before the final request handler is executed. They are commonly used for tasks like authentication, logging, and data parsing.
Server: A computer or software that provides services to other computers or clients over a network. In this case, it refers to the backend application that handles requests.
Client: A device or software that requests and displays web content from a server. In the context of a chatroom, clients are the users participating in the chat.
Request: A message sent from a client to a server, typically asking for information or an action to be performed.
Response: The message sent from the server back to the client in response to a request, typically containing data or the result of an action.
Frontend: The client-side of a web application, responsible for user interface and interactions.
UI (User Interface): The visual elements and controls that users interact with on a website or application.
UX (User Experience): The overall experience a user has when interacting with a website or application, encompassing usability, design, and satisfaction.
Real-Time Communication: Communication that occurs without noticeable delay, enabling instant interactions between users.
Deployment: The process of making a web application accessible on the internet, typically involving hosting it on a server or cloud platform.
Server-Side Scripting: The execution of scripts on the server to generate dynamic web content, handle data, and perform other server-side tasks.
Client-Side Scripting: The execution of scripts in the user's web browser to enhance interactivity and manipulate the webpage.



WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT PROPOSED SOLUTION:
Positive Feedback Mechanism: Implement a mechanism that allows users to react positively to messages. For example, users could click on an emoji or an icon that represents positive emotions like "support," "empathy," or "strength."

Anonymous Feedback: To maintain the safe and anonymous nature of the chatroom, make sure the feedback remains anonymous. Users won't know who provided the positive reaction to their message.

Visible Acknowledgment: Whenever a user's message receives positive feedback, the original message could be visually highlighted or marked, indicating that others in the chatroom appreciate the expression of emotions and are offering support.

Encourage Encouragement: Promote a culture of encouragement and positivity by gently encouraging users to provide positive feedback to others' messages. This could be done through occasional prompts or reminders.

Wellness Points or Achievements: To further motivate users, you could introduce a wellness point system. Users who consistently provide positive feedback and create a supportive atmosphere could earn "wellness points" or achievements. This could create a sense of community and shared purpose.

Moderation and Reporting: While promoting positivity, also ensure that the chatroom remains a safe space. Implement mechanisms to report inappropriate content, and have moderators who can step in to address any concerns.


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
The future enhancements would be to add a bot which would use sentiment analysis to check if the post chat is a derogatory chat or just a vent out and if the threshold of the sentiment analysis bot goes below a point it will delete the message and will a time out to that user or will direct him to professional mental health aids.
